FormaFlow is a dynamic, schema-driven Form Template Builder that empowers users to create beautiful, responsive, and highly functional forms with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This project was built to fulfill a technical assignment but was approached with a product-minded focus on superior user experience, fluid animations, and a scalable architecture.

## üöÄ Core Features

### Builder Module
*   **Intuitive Drag & Drop:** Effortlessly reorder fields or drag new ones from the palette onto the canvas, even into an empty list.
*   **Inline Editing Experience:** Click any field to reveal a rich editor panel directly below, with changes reflected in real-time.
*   **Auto-Saving:** All changes are automatically saved to local storage after a brief pause in typing, with a clear status indicator (`Saving...`, `All changes saved`) in the header.
*   **High-Fidelity Previews:** The canvas shows a realistic, disabled preview of how each field (text, dropdowns, file uploads) will look to the end-user.
*   **Rich Field Palette:** A comprehensive set of field types including text, paragraph, dropdown, radio, checkbox, image, and file uploads.
*   **Advanced UX Features:**
    *   **Template Settings Modal:** A focused modal to edit a template's name and description.
    *   **Duplicate Field:** Instantly clone any field and its configuration with a single click.
    *   **Add Between:** A subtle "+" icon appears on hover to add new fields exactly where you want them.
    *   **Scroll-to-Active:** The view automatically centers on the field you're editing for a seamless workflow.

### Form & Submission Module
*   **Schema-Driven Rendering:** Forms are dynamically generated from the template's JSON schema, making the system incredibly flexible.
*   **Interactive File Previews:** Users can upload images or PDFs and preview them in a pop-up modal before submitting.
*   **Robust Validation:** Utilizes `react-hook-form` for client-side validation based on rules set in the builder (e.g., "required").
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** All templates and form submissions are saved to the browser's local storage.

### General UX & Polish
*   **Polished & Consistent UI:** A clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS, designed to be both beautiful and functional.
*   **Purposeful Animations:** Fluid animations using Framer Motion provide satisfying user feedback without being distracting.
*   **Thoughtful Edge Case Handling:** Gracefully handles empty states, unsaved changes warnings, and 404 errors on production refresh.
*   **Accessible Modals:** Confirmation and settings modals feature focus-trapping and keyboard controls (`Esc` to close) for better accessibility.

### Architectural Pattern
The application is built on a **Schema-Driven Rendering** architecture. This means the UI is dynamically generated from a JSON "schema" (our template object). This pattern decouples the data from the presentation, making the system highly scalable, maintainable, and flexible.
